/*
Handle exception in number
Problem statement: 
Get the input String from user and parse it to integer, if it is not a number it will throw 
number format exception Catch it and print "Entered input is not a valid format for an integer."
or else print the square of that number. (Refer Sample Input and Output). 
Sample input and output 1: 
Enter an integer: 12
The square value is 144
The work has been done successfully

/*
Write a program that takes as input the size of the array and the elements in the array. 
The program then asks the user to enter a particular index and prints the element at that index.
 This program may generate Array Index Out Of Bounds Exception. Use exception handling mechanisms 
 to handle this exception. In the catch block, print the class name of the exception thrown.
 
Sample Input and Output 1:
Enter the number of elements in the array
3
Enter the elements in the array
20
90
4
Enter the index of the array element you want to access
2
The array element at index 2 = 4
The array element successfully accessed
Sample Input and Output 2:
Enter the number of elements in the array
3
Enter the elements in the array
20
90
4
Enter the index of the array element you want to access
6

/*
Write a class MathOperation which accepts integers from command line. 
Create an array using these parameters. Loop through the array and obtain the sum and 
average of all the elements. 
Display the result. 
Check for various exceptions that may arise like ArithmeticException, NumberFormatException, and so on.
For example: The class would be invoked as follows: 
C:>java MathOperation 1900, 4560, 0, 32500

------------
/*
Write a Program with a division method who receives two integer numbers and performs the 
division operation. The method should declare that it throws ArithmeticException. 
This exception should be handled in the main method.

/*
Write a Program to take care of Number Format Exception if user enters values other than 
integer for calculating average marks of 2 students. The name of the students and marks 
in 3 subjects are taken from the user while executing the program.
In the same Program write your own Exception classes to take care of Negative values and 
values out of range (i.e. other than in the range of 0-100)
